# Scratch & Map

Oh, the places you've gone! And the adventures that are still ahead of you! Travel can make the world feel smaller, but also more grand and beautifulâ€”which is exactly how this interactive art presents it.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install [Python](wwww.python.org) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

If you are running a version of Python older than 3.4, you will also need to install [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/)

### Installing

1. For Python 3.4 or newer:
   Run ```python3 -m venv venv```.

For versions of Python older than 3.4, see above for virtualenv installation.

Continuing for all versions:

2. Run ```virtualenv venv```

3. Mac - Run ```source venv/bin/activate```
   Windows - Run ```venv\Scripts\activate```

4. Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
